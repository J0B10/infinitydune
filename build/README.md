# Build Information

I use [jadc/modpack-manifest-generator](https://github.com/jadc/modpack-manifest-generator) to generate the `manifest.json` that would normally be generated by cursedforge.

A list with the project ids of all mods in the pack can be found in [`mods.txt`](mods.txt).  

If you are on windows you'll need to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/) or [git bash with wget installed](https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058) to run bash scripts. Additionally you'll need python3.  

To build the modpack just run `./build.sh` from **this directory** and it will generate everything inside the `out` folder.  
Just zip it and import it in multimc. That's all.  

Sometimes the cursedforge servers or api seem to have some hiccups (at least for me, maybe I'm running into rate limits :sweat_smile:) and the generator script throws a `JSONDecodeError`, complaining about a `(char 0)`.  
Then just wait a bit, drink some hot fluids and try again later.
