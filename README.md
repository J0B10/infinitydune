# [WorkingTitle] `infinitydune` 

You find yourself out in a never ending dessert with nothing to do and everything looking to kill you.  
Even the wood for a crafting table is missing!  
But if you look carefully the dessert provides you with a lot of stuff that you can use to improve your situation.  
Just think out of the box!

## Progression
![ores](https://imgur.com/0eAtybl.png)
### Stone age
Focused around getting first basic resources like food, wood, water, stone and dirt.
You will need Tinkers Construct to build some tools and armor.
Also you can make your first steps in Astral Sorcery and Botania.
Finally go mining to find some copper, tin or aluminium. 
Then create a smeltery to alloy some bronze to advance to the next age.
### Bronze Age
You'll now also be able to mine redstone.
Advancing further in Botania will allow you to obtain more resources using rituals and alchemy. 
Building an Astral Gateway to move arround quickly could be beneficial.
Sacrifice your own blood to get started wit Blood Magic and build the first stages of the altar.
Colossal chests and Storage Drawers might help you organizing your storage.
The key to further progression is hearthwell. 
It allows to build some advanced machinery but will need a new source of power. 
But for that your crafting capabillities will have to advance.
After all the OrePuller will be able to pull up more ores like iron, gold, silver, lapis and more.

### Iron Age
_//TODO iron age is still work in progress._  
Main aspect should be the industrialization and automation.
Mods involved shall be embers, Immersive Engineering but also some more Hwell. Obtaining iron will also allow you to advance deeper into Astral Sorcery, Botania and BloodMagic.
