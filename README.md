_You find yourself out in a never ending desert with nothing to do and everything looking to kill you.
Even the wood for a crafting table is missing!
But if you look carefully the desert provides you with a lot of stuff that you can use to improve your situation.
Just think out of the box!_

This modpack aims to do a lot of things different.

In many ways it is similar to Skyblock modpacks as a lot of resources are not available the way you are used to.
Only a very limited variation of ores spawns naturally, everything else has to be obtained by playing various mods.

It is not meant to be extremely hardcore or grindy, but you need a basic knowledge of the mods in this pack.
So you should have played at least most of them before.
There are no quests to hold your hand!

However there are advancements to provide you some guidance.

And be careful, the nights in the desert are deadly!

Originally the modpack was created for 1.12 but left unfinished. Now I'm aiming to bring back some life to it by porting it to 1.20 and adding a ton of new mods and plottwists.
